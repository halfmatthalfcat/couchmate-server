# Quill Queries

We leverage Quill to build compile-time queries.

## Building Queries

Leverage the Quill DSL to build queries.

*Note: Do not type your queries due to the way Quill
builds compile-time representations. It causes type widening
and will result in dynamic queries instead of static ones*
